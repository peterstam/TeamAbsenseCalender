# TeamAbsenseCalender
Keep track of the abence of your team

Open the Bezettingsprogramma.pro file in qt-creator and configure it to your needs.
This is a basic program and you can make changes to improve it

This is mainly a program for keeping track of the absense of your team 
it has three levels;

basic, a person can only make changes for his owm id-number (personeelnr).

Admin, a person can also make changes for other people.

Beheer, a person can add new persons or teams.

This is not completely inplemented yet, if i have time i will inplement it

The hard work of making a good working template was the big chalange, programming the rest is just work.
Hope this wil be a nice basic template.

It makes use of QSqlDatabase and QAbstractTableModel.

PS: because i am Dutch most of the comments are in Dutch (sorry for this)
